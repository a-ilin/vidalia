                  Building a Windows Vidalia Installer

0. Introduction

This document describes the procedure for building an executable Windows
installer for Vidalia. For information on building a Windows bundle installer,
please see Vidalia's pkg/win32/build-bundle.txt.

Before building the Vidalia installer for the first time, you will need to
download and install a recent version of NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install
System). NSIS can be downloaded from the following website:

    http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download 

You will also need all of the prerequisites necessary for building Vidalia,
such as Qt and CMake. These requirements are detailed in the INSTALL file, in
the root of Vidalia's source tree.

To sign the resulting installer suitable for distribution, you will need to 
install GnuPG or PGP. GnuPG can be downloaded here:

1. Compiling the Installer

The following steps describe the process used to create Vidalia's "release"
executable installers.


1.1. Compile a 'release' Version of Vidalia

  First, extract Vidalia's source to a directory, or fetch the latest
  revision from our Subversion repository.

    http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/GettingTheCode

  In the root of Vidalia's source tree, create a build directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
  
  Configure Vidalia as follows:

    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=minsizerel ..

  Finally, compile Vidalia by running:
  
    make


1.2. Collect Required Dependencies 

  Create a "bin" directory by running the following command from your build
  directory:

    mkdir bin


  Copy the following Qt .dll files from your Qt installation into your "bin"
  directory:

    copy $QTDIR\QtCore4.dll bin\
    copy $QTDIR\QtGui4.dll bin\
    copy $QTDIR\QtNetwork4.dll bin\
    copy $QTDIR\QtXml4.dll bin\
  
  where "$QTDIR" is the path to your Qt installation.


  Copy the MinGW .dll file into your "bin" directory:

    copy $MINGWDIR\bin\mingwm10.dll bin\

  where "$MINGWDIR" is the path to your MinGW installation.


  Copy the Vidalia executable into your "bin" directory:

    copy src\vidalia\vidalia.exe bin\


1.3. Create the Executable Installer

  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to
 
    $BUILDIR\pkg\win32
  
  where "$BUILDIR" is replaced by the path to the build directory you created
  in Step 1.1.2 above.

  Locate the file "vidalia.nsi" and right-click on it. From the context menu,
  select "Compile NSIS Script". You will see an NSIS window appear and display
  some progress information while it compiles the installer. When it completes,
  you will have a complete Vidalia installation executable located in:

    $BUILDIR\pkg\win32\vidalia-$VERSION.exe

  where "$VERSION" is the version of Vidalia for which the installer was built.


1.4. Sign the Package (optional, recommended)

  From the root of Vidalia's source tree, run the following commands:

    cd pkg\win32
    gpg -ba vidalia-$VERSION.exe

  where "$VERSION" is replaced by the version of Vidalia for which you just
  built a Windows installer.
