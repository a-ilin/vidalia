                  Building a Windows Vidalia Installer

0. Introduction

This document describes the procedure for building an executable Windows
installer for Vidalia. For information on building a Windows bundle installer,
please see Vidalia's pkg/win32/build-bundle.txt.

You will all of the prerequisites necessary for building Vidalia, such as
Qt and CMake. These requirements are detailed in the INSTALL file, in the
root of Vidalia's source tree. If you need to build OpenSSL from source
(Step 2 below), you will also need Microsoft Visual Studio installed.
These instructions were tested with Visual Studio 2008 Professional, but
may work with earlier versions of Visual Studio as well.

To sign the resulting installer suitable for distribution, you will need to 
install GnuPG or PGP. GnuPG can be downloaded here:

  http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html


The following steps describe the process used to create Vidalia's
"release" installers. Note that these instructions use the character ">"
to represent a command prompt. Yours probably looks slightly different.


1. Install the Windows Installer XML Toolset

Vidalia uses the Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX) to create a .msi
installer file from a source file generated from pkg/win32/vidalia.wxs.in,
so you must have WiX 3.0 or later installed.  This only needs to be done
once.
  
If you already have WiX installed, you can skip to the next step.
Otherwise, download and run the most recent WiX installer from here: 

    http://wix.sourceforge.net/downloadv3.html


2. Download and build OpenSSL

The OpenSSL DLL files shipped in Vidalia's Windows installers are compiled
with the static version of the Microsoft Visual C Runtime (MSVCRT).  Doing
so allows Qt's OpenSSL support to function on computers without the latest
MSVCRT installed, which is important for portable installations such as
the Tor Browser Bundle.

If you have previously completed this step, you can skip to Step 3. If you
do not want to compile OpenSSL from source, you can use the pre-built
OpenSSL libraries available here:

    http://pasiphae.cs.rpi.edu/~edmanm/vidalia/openssl-0.9.8k.zip
    http://pasiphae.cs.rpi.edu/~edmanm/vidalia/openssl-0.9.8k.zip.asc (sig)

Otherwise, continue with the steps below.

2.1. Download the OpenSSL 0.9.8k source code from here:

    http://www.openssl.org/source/

You should verify PGP signature or SHA1 hash of the file you download.

2.2. Extract the source code to a directory on your hard drive. In the
interest of simplifying exposition, let %OPENSSLDIR% denote the location
to which you extract the OpenSSL source code.

2.3. Configure the OpenSSL source code by running:

    > perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix C:/OpenSSL/0.9.8k

You can replace "C:/OpenSSL/0.9.8k" with another directory of your choice,
but you MUST use forward slashes in the path.

2.4. Build the assembly language files by running:

    > ms\do_masm

2.5. Open ms\ntdll.mak in a text editor and find the line that starts with
"CFLAG=". Change the "/MD" argument near the start of that line to "/MT".

2.6. In the same file, find the line that starts with "LFLAGS". Add the
argument "/manifest:no" to the end of it. Save your changes and close the
editor.

2.7. From a Visual Studio command prompt, compile OpenSSL by running:

    > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak

2.8. After OpenSSL has finished compiling, you can test and install it by
running:

    > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test
    > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install

2.9. After the "install" command completes, your OpenSSL libraries will be
copied to the install prefix specified in Step 2.3 above.


3. Compile a 'release' Version of Vidalia

3.1. First, extract Vidalia's source to a directory, or fetch the latest
revision from our Subversion repository.

    https://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/GettingTheCode

3.2. In the root of Vidalia's source tree, create a build directory and
'cd' into it:

    > mkdir build
    > cd build
  
3.3. Configure Vidalia as follows:

    > cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=minsizerel \
            -DMINGW_BINARY_DIR=C:\<PathToMinGW>\bin            \
            -DOPENSSL_BINARY_DIR=C:\<PathToOpenSSL>\bin        \
            -DWIX_BINARY_DIR=C:\<PathToWiX>\bin ..

MINGW_BINARY_DIR should point to the MinGW installation directory that
contains mingwm10.dll. OPENSSL_BINARY_DIR should point to the OpenSSL
directory that contains ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll. If you compiled
OpenSSL from source in Step 2.

3.4. Finally, compile Vidalia by running:
  
    > make

4. Create the Installer .msi File

After the previous 'make' command has completed, you can run:

    > make dist-win32

When it completes, you will have a complete Vidalia installer located in
the current directory named 'vidalia-$VERSION.msi', where $VERSION is the
version of the Vidalia source code you compiled.


4.1. Sign the completed installer (optional, recommended)

From the root of Vidalia's source tree, run the following commands:

    > gpg -ba vidalia-$VERSION.msi

where "$VERSION" is replaced by the version of Vidalia for which you just
built a Windows installer.
