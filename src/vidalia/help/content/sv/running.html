<p>
Vidalia can help you control your Tor process by letting you start and stop
Tor, as well as monitoring Tor's status and letting you know if it exits
unexpectedly.
</p>

<a name="starting"/>

<h3>Övervakar Tors ställning</h3>
<p>
Vidalia tells you about the status of Tor by displaying an icon in your system
tray or dock area. The following table shows the different states indicated by
an icon in your system's notification area:
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
    <td><img src="qrc:/images/32x32/tor-off.png"/></td>
    <td valign="middle">
      Tor is stopped. Select <i>Start</i> from the Vidalia menu
      to start Tor.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="qrc:/images/32x32/tor-starting.png"/></td>
    <td valign="middle">
      Tor is starting up. You can check the 
      <a href="log.html">message log</a> for status information about Tor
      while it is starting.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="qrc:/images/32x32/tor-on.png"/></td>
    <td valign="middle">
      Tor is running. If you want to stop Tor, select <i>Stop</i> from the
      Vidalia menu. Tor will print informational messages to the 
      <a href="log.html">message log</a> while it is running, if you want to 
      see what Tor is doing.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="qrc:/images/32x32/tor-stopping.png"/></td>
    <td valign="middle">Tor is in the process of shutting down.</td>

red X and display an error message letting you know what went wrong. You can
also check the <a href="log.html">message log</a> for details about any problems
Tor encountered before it exited.
