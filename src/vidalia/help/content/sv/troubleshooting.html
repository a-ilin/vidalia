<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<hr />

Listed below are some of the common problems or questions people have while
running Tor. If you can't find anything about the particular problem you're
having, check out our website at <i>www.vidalia-project.net</i> for more
support and information.

<a name="start"/>
<h3>I Can't Start Tor</h3>
<p>
The most likely reason that Vidalia could not start Tor is because Vidalia is
looking for your Tor installation in the wrong directory. You can tell Vidalia
where Tor is located by updating the <i>Tor Executable</i> option in the 
<a href="config.html#general">general configuration settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another possible reason that Tor cannot start is because there is already
another Tor process running. Check your list of running process and stop the
previous Tor process, if you find one. Then, try running Tor again.
</p>
<p>
If that did not help, check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor printed any information about errors it encountered
while trying to start.
</p>

<a name="connect"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Connect to Tor</h3>
<p>
Vidalia manages Tor by communicating with it via Tor's <i>control port</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The most common reason that Vidalia cannot connect to Tor is because Tor
started, but encountered an error and exited immediately. You should
check your <a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if Tor reported any
errors while it started.
</p>
<p>
If Tor is listening on a different port than Vidalia expects, Vidalia will
be unable to connect to Tor. You rarely need to change this setting, but if
there is another service running on your machine that conflicts with Tor's 
control port, you will need to specify a different port. You can change this
setting in Vidalia's <a href="config.html#advanced">advanced configuration
settings</a>.
</p>

<h3>Tor har oväntat avslutats</h3> 
<p> 
If Tor exits immediately after trying to start, you most likely have
another Tor process already running. Check the <a href="log.html">message log</a> to
see if any of the last few messages in the list are highlighted in yellow and
contain a message similar to the following:
</p>
<pre>
connection_create_listener(): Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Address already in use. 
Is Tor already running?
</pre>
<p>
If you find an error message like the one above, you will need to stop the other
Tor process before starting a new one with Vidalia. On Windows, you would need
to look for <i>tor.exe</i> in your Task Manager. On most other operating systems,
the <i>ps</i> command can help you find the other Tor process.
</p>
<p>
If Tor had been running successfully for awhile (that is, longer than a few
seconds), then you should check the <a href="log.html">message log</a> for
information about any errors Tor experienced before it exited. Such errors
will be highlighted in either red or yellow.
</p>

<a name="stop"/>
<h3>Vidalia kan inte stoppa Tor</h3>
<p>
If Vidalia cannot stop Tor, you should check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor reported any errors while trying to exit.
