<h1>Bridge Relays</h1>
<hr />

<a name="about"/>
<h3>What are bridge relays?</h3>
<p>
Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are Tor relays that aren't listed
in the main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them,
even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays,
they probably won't be able to block all the bridges.
</p>

<h3>Hur kan jag hitta en brygga?</h3>
<p>
There are two main ways to learn about a bridge address: 
<ol>
  <li>Get some friends to run private bridges for you</li>
  <li>Use some of the public bridges</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To use private bridges, ask your friends to run Vidalia and Tor in an
uncensored area of the Internet, and then click on <i>Help censored users</i>
in Vidalia's <a href="server.html">Relay settings page</a>. Then they should
privately send you the <i>Bridge address</i> line at the bottom of their
Relay page. Unlike running an exit relay, running a bridge relay just passes
data to and from the Tor network, so it shouldn't expose the operator to any
abuse complaints.
</p>

<p>
You can find public bridge addresses by visiting
<b>https://bridges.torproject.org</b>.
The answers you get from that page will change every few days, so check back
periodically if you need more bridge addresses. Another way to find public
bridge addresses is to send mail to <b>bridges@torproject.org</b> with the line 
<b>get bridges</b> by itself in the body of the mail. However, so we can make
it harder for an attacker to learn lots of bridge addresses, you must send
this request from a Gmail or Yahoo! account.
</p>

<p>
Configuring more than one bridge address will make your Tor connection
more stable, in case some of the bridges become unreachable.
