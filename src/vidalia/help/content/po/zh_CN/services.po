"Hidden services allow you to provide any kind of TCP-based service, e.g. an "
"HTTP service, to others without revealing your IP address. The protocol to "
"provide a hidden service is built on top of the same circuits that Tor uses "
"for anonymous browsing and roughly has similar anonymity properties."

"Virtual Port (required): This is the TCP port that clients will need to know "

"Target (optional): Usually you want Tor to relay connection requests to "

"Port\". Therefore, you can specify a target consisting of physical address "
"and port to which requests to your hidden service are redirected, e.g. to "
"localhost:5222 (or on whatever port your server is listening). If you don't "

"\"Virtual Port\" on localhost."

"Service Directory (required): Tor needs to store some hidden-service "
"specific files in a separate directory, e.g. a private key and a hostname "
"file containing the onion address. This directory should be distinct from a "
"directory containing content that the service provides. A good place for a "
"service directory might be a sub directory in Tor's data directory. -- Note "
"that you cannot change the directory of a running service (it wouldn't make "
"much sense to allow it, because Vidalia is not supposed to move directories "
"on your hard disk!). If you want to move a hidden service to another "
"directory, please proceed as follows: Start by disabling the service in "
"Vidalia and save the configuration. Then move the directory on your hard "
"disk to the new place. Finally, change the directory in Vidalia to the new "
"location, enable the service again, and save the new configuration."
