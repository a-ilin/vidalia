"Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from "
"accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor relays. "
"Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are relays that help these "
"censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor relays, bridges are "
"not listed in the same public directories as normal relays. Since there is "
"no complete public list of them, even if your ISP is filtering connections "
"to all the known Tor relays, they probably won't be able to block all the "
"bridges."

"To use private bridges, ask your friends to run Vidalia and Tor in an "
"uncensored area of the Internet, and then click on <i>Help censored "
"users</i> in Vidalia's <a href=\"server.html\">Relay settings page</a>. Then"
" they should privately send you the <i>Bridge address</i> line at the bottom"
" of their Relay page. Unlike running an exit relay, running a bridge relay "
"just passes data to and from the Tor network, so it shouldn't expose the "
"operator to any abuse complaints."

"You can find public bridge addresses by visiting "
"<b>https://bridges.torproject.org</b>.  The answers you get from that page "
"will change every few days, so check back periodically if you need more "
"bridge addresses. Another way to find public bridge addresses is to send "
"mail to <b>bridges@torproject.org</b> with the line <b>get bridges</b> by "
"itself in the body of the mail. However, so we can make it harder for an "
"attacker to learn lots of bridge addresses, you must send this request from "
"a Gmail account."
